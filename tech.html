    <h3>Agricultural Techniques</h3>
    <p class="ms-5">We will look at this entire concept of agriculture and agricultural techniques in this chapter. It will help you in understanding how the food network in our country performs. However, we will start from the basic question of what agriculture is. Letâ€™s find out more about Agricultural Techniques.</p>

            <h3 id="Introduction_to_Agriculture">Introduction to Agriculture.</h3>
            <p>Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. It includes the preparation of plant and animal products for people to use and their distribution to markets. Agriculture provides most of the world's food and fabrics.</p>
            <p>Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage.</p>
        
            <h3 id="Agricultural_techniques">Agricultural Techniques</h3>
            <p>Each of the crops needs different growth conditions, different harvesting seasons and different attention. There are some common techniques of agriculture that farmers in India follow.

                They include ploughing, use of modern machinery, fertilizers, various types of seeds etc. </p>
            <img src="1000.jpeg">
            <p> If all the farmers will grow only one kind of seeds and crops, the price for these seeds and crops would fall and there would be no profit to the farmers.

                Moreover, growing same kind of seeds and crop on the same land will extract the same minerals from the soil each time and as a result, the soil will be deprived of these minerals. Therefore, farmers follow various techniques like the seasonal rotation of crops to maintain the nutrient content of the soil.</p>

            <h3 id="Changes_in_Food_Over_the_Years">Change in Food Over Years</h3>
            <p>Earlier people used to eat a variety of foods like bajra, jowar, wheat etc. But now, we are eating mainly wheat. Earlier the old seeds were stored and grown in the next year. Nowadays, new variants of seeds are grown and their products are quite different in taste.

                Previously, people ate the foods in very simple forms, not very much spicy and overheated. Earlier, the traditional methods of irrigation, ploughing etc. were used whereas nowadays, new methods of irrigation, ploughing are being used.</p>

            <h3 id="Advancement_in_Agricultural_Techniques">Advancements in Agricultural Techniques</h3>
            <p>Too often we might think that with technological advancements, our lives have become better. Yes, it has. But, there are many problems that we face as well. Due to better transportation, better quality seeds, we do face a couple of problems. The common ones include</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use of expensive fertilizers and medicines for the crops give off a bad smell and also affect the soil texture.</li>
                <li>Due to increased farming, the water level got reduced.</li>
                <li>More variety of seeds attracted more insects and that causes greater problems for the farmers.</li>
                <li>Due to increased transportation facilities, the pollution in the cities is rising like never before.</li>
            </ul>
